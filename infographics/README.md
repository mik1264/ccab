This project showcases 20 different types of dynamic infographics, each demonstrating various data visualization techniques using vanilla web technologies. All visualizations are responsive, interactive, and feature smooth animations.

## Features

- **Pure HTML/CSS/JS**: No dependencies, no build tools required
- **Fully Interactive**: Hover effects, tooltips, and click interactions
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS transitions and JavaScript animations
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful gradients and contemporary design patterns

## Infographics Included

1. **Area Chart** - Stacked area chart showing cumulative data trends over time
2. **Line Chart** - Smooth animated line chart with gradient fills and tooltips
3. **Network Graph** - Interactive node-link diagram showing network connections
4. **Radar Chart** - Multi-dimensional spider chart for skill assessment profiles
5. **Timeline** - Vertical timeline visualization with animated event cards
6. **Liquid Fill Gauge** - Water-level visualization with animated wave effects
7. **3D Card Flip Stats** - Interactive flip cards revealing detailed metrics on hover
8. **Particle Animation** - Interactive particle network with real-time connections
9. **Glassmorphism Dashboard** - Modern glass-effect design with blur and transparency
10. **Neon Glow Chart** - Cyberpunk-style visualization with glowing neon effects
11. **Morphing Blob Chart** - Organic shapes with smooth morphing animations
12. **Animated Gradient Stats** - Colorful flowing gradients with dynamic animations
13. **Circular Progress Ring** - Multi-ring progress indicators with smooth animations
14. **Wave Animation Chart** - Flowing water-based visualization with wave effects
15. **3D Rotating Pyramid** - Geometric 3D shapes with continuous rotation animation
16. **Neumorphism Cards** - Soft UI design with subtle shadow effects
17. **Animated Path Drawing** - SVG line animation with progressive drawing effect
18. **Holographic Effect** - Futuristic hologram-style visualization with color shifts
19. **Parallax Scroll Stats** - Depth-based scrolling with interactive parallax layers
20. **3D Cube Visualization** - Interactive rotating cubes with multi-colored faces

## Technical Details

### Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup and SVG graphics
- **CSS3**: Flexbox, Grid, animations, transitions, and gradients
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: DOM manipulation, event handling, and animations

### Key Features

- **SVG Graphics**: Used for charts and diagrams requiring precise shapes
- **CSS Animations**: Smooth transitions and keyframe animations
- **Event Listeners**: Interactive hover and click effects
- **Responsive Layout**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for adaptive layouts
- **No Dependencies**: All code is self-contained

## Customization

Each infographic is self-contained in its own HTML file, making it easy to:

- Modify data values
- Change color schemes
- Adjust animation timings
- Customize layouts
- Extract individual components

### Example: Customizing Data

Each infographic contains its own data that can be easily modified. For example, open any infographic file and locate the data array to customize values, colors, and labels to match your needs.

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

All modern browsers with ES6+ support are compatible.
