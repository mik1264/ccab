## Overview

CCAB (Claude Code and Algorithmic Beauty) is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect and how we use it.

## Data We Collect

### Information We Do NOT Collect

- Personal identification information
- Email addresses
- Cookies for tracking
- User accounts or passwords
- Payment information

### Technical Information

When you visit CCAB, standard web server logs may record:
- IP address (anonymized)
- Browser type
- Pages visited
- Timestamp

This information is used solely for maintaining service quality and is not linked to individual users.

### Local Storage

Some demos may use browser local storage to:
- Save user preferences (e.g., reduced motion settings)

This data stays on your device and is not transmitted to any server.

## Third-Party Services

### CDN Libraries

Demos load JavaScript libraries from content delivery networks (CDNs) such as:
- unpkg.com
- cdnjs.cloudflare.com
- fonts.googleapis.com

These services have their own privacy policies.

### GitHub Pages

If hosted on GitHub Pages, GitHub's privacy policy applies to hosting infrastructure.

## Children's Privacy

CCAB is suitable for all ages. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.

## Data Security

We do not store personal data, so there is no personal data to secure. The website is served over HTTPS.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect personal data, there is no personal data to access, correct, or delete.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy. Changes will be noted with an updated date.
