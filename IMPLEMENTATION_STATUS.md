## 📦 Post-Implementation: Consolidation & Curation

- Used `git worktree` strategy for parallel development
- Each branch tested and verified before merge
- All worktrees removed after successful merge
- Failed branches deleted to maintain repository cleanliness

### Phase 2: Quality Curation (Nov 2025)
Systematic review and refinement of galleries to keep only highest quality demos:

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### From Automated Generation
1. **Automated generation works better for well-defined frameworks** than complex simulations
2. **Physics simulations require careful optimization** - automatic implementations struggled
3. **Visual frameworks** (graphics libraries) are easier to automate than **behavioral simulations**
4. **Performance testing** should be part of acceptance criteria
5. **Redundancy** can occur with multiple similar branches (threejs-3d vs threejs-integration)
6. **68% success rate** is actually quite good for automated implementation

### From Curation Process
7. **Quality over quantity** - 348 curated demos > 560 uncurated demos
8. **Framework-based galleries benefit from selectivity** - showing best examples improves learning
9. **38% reduction** improved user experience without sacrificing coverage
10. **Curation criteria matter** - visual impact, uniqueness, and educational value are key
11. **Category balance** - kept full collections for some (P5, Web Audio), heavily curated others (WebGPU 40→12, WebAssembly 40→13, Biological 40→22, Complex 40→15)
12. **User experience** - Less overwhelming gallery = better exploration and learning
13. **Performance-focused curation** - Scientific, WebAssembly, Biological, and Complex galleries benefit from focusing on most performant and visually impressive examples
