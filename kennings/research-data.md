### Rune Poem References

Proto-Germanic rune names are reconstructed from three medieval rune poems:

- **Old Icelandic Rune Poem** (c. 1400 CE) -- 16 stanzas for the Younger Futhark
- **Anglo-Saxon Rune Poem** (c. 8th-9th century) -- 29 stanzas for the Futhorc

The Elder Futhark names are scholarly reconstructions in Proto-Germanic, based on these later sources plus the Gothic alphabet letter-names.

## V. KENNING FORMATION RULES AND PATTERNS

### Basic Structure

A kenning is a **nominal periphrasis**: two nouns (as a compound or in genitive relationship) that refer to a **third, unspoken noun** (the *referent*).

```
KENNING = BASE-WORD + DETERMINANT --> REFERENT

Example: hron-rad (whale + road) --> the sea
         Base: "road" (something the sea resembles)
         Determinant: "whale" (what specifies THIS kind of road)
         Referent: the sea (the unspoken thing being described)
```

### Key Terms

| Term | Old Norse | Definition | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Kenning** | kenning | Two-noun metaphorical compound | hron-rad = whale-road = sea |
| **Base-word** | stofnord | The noun that resembles the referent | "road" in whale-road |
| **Determinant** | kenniorð | The noun that specifies the base-word | "whale" in whale-road |
| **Referent** | -- | The unspoken thing being described | "the sea" |
| **Heiti** | heiti | A simple poetic synonym (NOT a kenning) | "steed" for horse, "billow" for wave |
| **Nykrat kenning** | nykrat | A "real" kenning (two nouns, metaphorical) | "raven-feeder" = warrior |
| **Vidkenning** | vidkenning | An extended/multi-level kenning | "fire of the serpent's bed" = gold |

### Heiti vs. Kenning

- **Heiti**: A single poetic synonym. No metaphorical compound. Example: *brandr* (brand/fire-sword) for "sword."
- **Kenning**: A compound of two (or more) nouns creating a metaphor. Example: *ben-eldr* (wound-fire) for "sword."

The distinction matters because heiti are simple substitutions, while kennings create new meaning through the interaction of their parts.

### Formation Patterns

#### Pattern 1: X of Y (Genitive)
The determinant is in the genitive case.
- **blod Ymis** (blood of Ymir) = the sea
- **tar Freyju** (tears of Freyja) = gold
- **dreyri Kvasis** (blood of Kvasir) = poetry

#### Pattern 2: X-Y (Compound)
The two elements form a single compound word.
- **hron-rad** (whale-road) = the sea
- **ban-hus** (bone-house) = the body
- **heofon-candel** (heaven-candle) = the sun

#### Pattern 3: Extended/Nested Kenning (Vidkenning)
One or both elements are themselves kennings, creating layers.
- **eldr orms beks** (fire of the serpent's bed) = gold
  - serpent's bed = gold (dragons sleep on gold)
  - fire of [gold] = gold (gold gleams like fire)
- **nausta blakks hle-mana gifrs drifu gim-slongvir** = warrior
  - This is a 6-element nested kenning from skaldic poetry

#### Pattern 4: Mythological Reference
The determinant references a specific myth.
- **har Sifjar** (Sif's hair) = gold (Loki cut Sif's hair, replaced with gold)
- **Frodha meldr** (Frodi's meal) = gold (the Grotti-mill ground gold)
- **feng Odhins** (Odin's prize) = poetry (Odin stole the mead)

#### Pattern 5: Personification / God-Name
A god's name serves as base or determinant.
- **Njordr swerda** (Njord of swords) = warrior
- **Gefn gulls** (Freyja of gold) = woman
- **Tyr bauganna** (Tyr of rings) = generous lord

#### Pattern 6: Nature Metaphor
Natural phenomena used as base-word.
- **eldr Aegis** (fire of Aegir) = gold
- **iss randa** (ice of shields) = sword
- **saevar hestr** (horse of the sea) = ship

### Semantic Categories (What Kennings Describe Most Often)

Based on frequency in the corpus:

1. **Battle** -- the richest category: storm, weather, clash, meeting, play, sending
2. **Warriors/Men** -- tree/ash/oak + war-gear; feeder/reddener + animals
3. **Gold** -- fire/flame/gleam + body parts or mythological references
4. **The Sea** -- road/path/land + sea-creatures; blood/body-parts of Ymir
5. **Ships** -- horse/deer/bear/ski + sea/wave terms
6. **Women** -- tree/goddess + garments/jewelry/drink
7. **Swords/Weapons** -- fire/ice/serpent/fish + shields/helmets/battle
8. **Blood** -- sea/wave/sweat/dew + wounds/swords/battle
9. **Poetry** -- blood/mead/drink/sea + Kvasir/dwarves/Odin
10. **Earth/Sky/Sun/Wind** -- body-parts of Ymir + cosmic structures
